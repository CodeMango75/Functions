# Q1 Create a function print_info that takes arbitrary keyword arguments representing a person's information (name, age, country) and prints them.

def print_info(**information):
    for name, value in information.items(): # In this code, I've used .items() to iterate through the key-value pairs of the information dictionary, and then I've printed the formatted output.
        print(f'{name}: {value}')

print_info(name="Talaal", age=27)



# Q2 Write a function calculate_total that takes arbitrary keyword arguments representing items and their prices, and returns the total cost.

def calculate_total(**invoice):
    total_cost = sum(invoice.values()) # invoice.values() extracts all the values (prices) from the keyword arguments provided. The sum() function then adds up these values to get the total cost.
    return total_cost

item_prices = { # This is a dictionary named item_prices that holds items as keys and their corresponding prices as values. For example, "Iphone" is a key, and 75000 is its corresponding value.
    "Iphone": 75000,
    "Laptop": 60000,
    "Headphones": 2000
}

total = calculate_total(**item_prices) # Here, you're calling the calculate_total function and passing the item_prices dictionary as keyword arguments using the ** operator. This is equivalent to passing individual keyword arguments like items="Iphone", price=75000.
print(f'Total cost: {total}') # Finally, you're printing the total cost calculated by the calculate_total function.

# Q3 Build a function merge_dicts that takes arbitrary keyword arguments representing dictionaries, and returns a merged dictionary.

def merge_dicts(**dictionaries):
    merged_dict = {}
    for dictionary in dictionaries.values():
        merged_dict.update(dictionary)
    return merged_dict

dictionary1 = {
    "Name": "Talaal",
    "Age": 27,
    "City": "Karachi"
}

dictionary2 = {
    "Name": "Manaal",
    "Age": 23,
    "City": "Karachi"
}

merged = merge_dicts(dict1=dictionary1, dict2=dictionary2)
print(merged)
